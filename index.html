  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I am a current PhD candidate at Monash University. My research interests lie in cortical prosthesis with my thesis specifically focussing on bionic vision. I am working to improve the achievable resolution with targeted stimulation in cortical implants through the application of current steering. My other interests relate to the processing of visual motion and how to recreate this using neurobionics. Outside of my thesis work, I teach undergraduate students in both the physiology and engineering faculties at Monash. </p>

  <h3>Education</h3>
  <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i>
  <p><b>Doctor of Philosophy | Monash University - 2020-present</b>
    I am currently working on assessing the effects of current steering within the visual cortex of rodents. This involves considerations to both the physiological connections between brain areas as well as the engineering components such as the electrode arrays, stimulation software and analysis software.

    <b>Bachelor of Biomedical Engineering (Honours) | RMIT University - 2016 – 2019</b>
    For my honours project, I constructed a prosthetic hand with passive, bistable mechanisms to improve contact forces of artificial fingers. This project required extensive mathematical computations within MATLAB and Autodesk Inventor in addition to knowledge about 3D printing and rapid prototyping.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <i class="fas fa-caret-down"></i>
    <b>Teaching assitant | Monash University - 2020-present</b>
•	Works with undergraduate students to assist them in completing their workshops/practicals
•	Ensured students understood the task and completed within the allotted time
•	Works in both the engineering and physiology faculties

    <b>Research intern | Polytechnique Montreal - 2019</b>
•	Designed, simulated and prototyped a biomimetic, bistable prosthetic index finger
•	Operated complex computer software i.e. AutoCAD, Autodesk Inventor, MATLAB
•	Conscientiously responded to supervisor’s requests
•	Worked with others to ensure accuracy of work
